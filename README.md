# Data Acqusition
Data science presents numerous fascinating and captivating challenges, ranging from identifying the most pertinent inquiries to selecting appropriate features, training models, and interpreting outcomes. However, all these endeavors depend on a well-organized and structured data set, amenable to analysis and modeling. Industry authorities concur that collecting and preparing data comprises approximately 75% of any analytical undertaking.


Although this course is named "Data Acquisition," we know that acquiring data is just the beginning. Once we obtain the data, we need to structure it into organized formats and often extract meaningful insights from raw data. For instance, we may need to condense a Twitter feed into a single positive or negative sentiment score for a particular user. This course will equip you with the necessary skills to collect, structure, consolidate, and extract insights from diverse data sources, setting you up for effective analysis work. In the process, you'll gain proficiency in various tools and technologies, such as the command line, git, and APIs.
